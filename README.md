## Abstract
The Live Tracking System for Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) using IoT is a proposed project that aims to provide real-time location tracking of DMRC trains to passengers and authorities. The project utilizes IoT devices and wireless communication technologies to collect and transmit data about the current location of the train.
The system consists of GPS sensors, microcontrollers, and wireless communication modules installed on each train. The GPS sensors collect the current location of the train, which is then processed by the microcontroller to determine the train's speed and direction. The wireless communication module transmits this data to a central server, which processes the data and presents it to passengers and authorities in real-time.
The proposed system will have a user-friendly interface accessible through a mobile application, web portal or kiosk. Passengers will be able to view real-time information about the train's location, its estimated time of arrival and departure, and any delays or disruptions on the route. The system will also provide DMRC authorities with valuable insights into train operations, enabling them to improve service quality and enhance safety measures.
The project aims to improve the commuting experience for passengers and optimize train operations for DMRC by providing accurate and up-to-date information about train movements. The Live Tracking System for DMRC Metro using IoT is a step towards a smarter and more connected transportation system, enabling efficient and seamless mobility for all.
